Hello, and welcome to Kubernetes!

In this course, we'll be learning fundamentals about Kubernetes live on a
real cloud provider, DigitalOcean. This means you'll be able to interact
with your cluster in a real dashboard, and it'll be live on the internet!

We're going to download a couple tools in this playground:

- `doctl`, the DigitalOcean command-line interface
- `kubectl`, the command-line interface for Kubernetes

You may see the `curl` commands go by that grab these tools. That's normal!
When the setup script completes its work, the screen will be cleared.
